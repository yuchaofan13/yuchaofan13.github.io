Hi, I'm Yuchao (范宇超). I recently graduated from the University of Cambridge where I studied Economics, specialising in econometrics, game theory and maths. I enjoy tackling quantitative/technical problems and building intelligent, automated solutions.

I've found that my training in economics has been very useful for developing mental models of what an ideal system might look like, and then using this as a baseline to identify problems and inefficiencies in a real system.

However, I'm very much an engineer at heart. I don't just want to find problems and inefficiencies; I want to solve them.
